# Vehicle Management System
Simple Java project about vehicles and drivers. Basic OOP stuff.

## What's inside
One abstract class `Vehicle` and three types of transport:
- **Car** - has doors and fuel type;
- **Motorcycle** - can have sidecar;
- **Truck** - has cargo capacity and axles;

Also `Driver` class for drivers

## How to run

```
Program creates some drivers, some vehicles, assigns drivers and after that shows info.

## What it does

For each vehicle it shows:
- Engine start
- Vehicle info (brand, year, specs)
- Driver info
- Engine stop

## Structure
Vehicle (abstract)
├── Car
├── Motorcycle
└── Truck

Driver (separate class)
Main (entry point) 
```

That's it.It works very simply.
